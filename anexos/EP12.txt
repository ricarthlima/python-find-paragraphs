abstract
The information communication technology (ICT) outsourcing market is growing larger
every year from the increasing number of companies that utilize ICT outsourcing, as industry scale increases and industrial specialization intensifies. However, the current circumstance is that security accidents related to ICT outsourcing are continuously occurring
at an increasing scale. There is a lack of studies measuring the level of security management
of organizational ICT outsourcing, which is the first step in performing security management of ICT outsourcing. In addition, most studies focus on general organizational security management. Accordingly, this paper aimed to design a model to measure the level of
security management of companies utilizing ICT outsourcing. Specifically, this paper analyzed security vulnerabilities that could occur in ICT outsourcing that may be mapped with
the accorded security measures as solutions to deduce items for ICT outsourcing security
inspections. Next, this paper developed an ICT outsourcing security level quantification
model by verifying the validity of the security inspection items deduced and by estimating
item-specific weighted points. Additionally, the applicability of the ICT outsourcing security level quantification model developed was verified by applying it to actual companies.

1. Background of the study
The effort to gain a competitive advantage in various industries from rapid advancements of industrial technologies is
increasing. As a main tool for competitive advantages, a combination of industry and information communication technology
(ICT) is becoming an essential operating factor of industrial advancement.
To establish and continue ICT operations, organizations require significant professional labor and technological prowess.
However, ICT is not the main business of most organizations and the significant cost needed to obtain significant professional
labor and technological prowess is an issue. Additionally, developing and operating ICT with a company’s own labor and
technological prowess alone is difficult. Accordingly, ‘‘ICT outsourcing’’ is utilized in most cases. Recently, the number
of cases of companies that concentrate on their core competencies while entrusting an ICT resource that is not a core

competency by breaking away from simply improving internal operational efficiency is increasing [9]. Accordingly, the
perception of ICT outsourcing is changing given the effort to gain industrial competitiveness. The ICT outsourcing market is
continuously growing as a result of the increasing and expanding scope of ICT outsourcing.
Utilizing outsourcing for ICT development and operations results in reducing a company’s ICT investment and
maintenance costs [1,5]. The issue of increasing security vulnerability exists – in contrast to when internal labor is utilized
for ICT development and operations – because such vulnerabilities increase from bringing in and taking out unauthorized
equipment and increasing the number of people that can access information. In this regard, security accidents from ICT
outsourcing have been increasing recently, which calls for extensive security management of outsourcing. Accordingly,
this paper aims to design a model to measure the level of security management for companies utilizing ICT outsourcing.
Specifically, this paper analyzes security vulnerabilities that could exist in ICT outsourcing that may be mapped with the
accorded security measures to design a system for ICT outsourcing security management.
2. Previous studies
Karabulut, Kerschbaum, Massacci, Robinson and Yautsiukhin [7] focus on the problem of guaranteeing appropriate
security when storing data on a contractor’s server. They introduce several important definitions and identify a number
of challenges and issues. They argue that external metrics are more meaningful for a client and propose some that can be
used for PLA. In their article, they focus more on the technical side of the agreement. One problem that they omit is the issue
of enforcement, which must be considered before applying PLA as a contract.
Hamlen and Thuraisingham [3] discuss various security challenges for outsourcing both data management and software
development activities. In particular, their paper discusses security issues pertaining to the data-as-a-service and softwareas-a-service models, and supply chain security issues. They also present relevant standards for data outsourcing. Their goal
is for the composite system to be secure even if the individual components developed by multiple organizations might
be compromised. They argue that data production has numerous similarities to developing a product in the supply chain
process, and data must be shared securely in the outsourcing process. In addition, security concerns for mobile code in
service-oriented architectures motivate the realization of security itself as a service.
Sherwood [14] examines the main issues concerning the security of business information in outsourced systems and
networks. He reviews the strategy that management should follow to ensure that its business information is adequately
secured under such conditions during pre-contract negotiations and that must be integral to the outsourcing agreement.
Khalfan [4] presents an overview of a national case study that explores the information security considerations in
information systems/information technology (IS/IT) outsourcing projects in the public and private sectors of Kuwait, where
the data collection for this study was carried out. The author states that organizations need to exercise caution when
selecting a partner (i.e., vendor). Additionally, organizations must properly and adequately address their security concerns
as they establish and develop their security policies, which should be concise, effective, and cover all security layers.
Outsourcing contracts should include robust provisions for information security, particularly in drafting the SLA. This study
may provide good input to IT policy makers and managers in different sectors in Kuwait. The findings also provide insights
into how, as an information system strategy, outsourcing practices are managed in the context of Kuwait.
Oladapo, Zavarsky, Ruhl, Lindskog, and Igonor [12] review and extract IT security risk elements that culminated in a
flowchart to aid decision making with respect to IT security outsourcing. This research, which reviews the NIST overview
approaches on IT security services acquisition and management, contributes to this area by conducting a more detailed
study on the initiation phase of the information security services life cycle and by introducing a decision-making flowchart
to complete this first phase of acquiring IT security services. This research will assist managers who need to make decisions
around IT security outsourcing. Although this research is an initial attempt at analyzing this topic, it represents an interesting
avenue for further studies in the expansion of other phases of the SDLC of outsourcing projects.
Zulkarnaen Khidzir, Mohamed, and Arshad [10] focus on conducting an empirical study on the relationship between the
difficulties and practices of information security risk management (ISRM) in ICT outsourcing. The findings of their study
show that the ISRM process difficulties influence the ICT outsourcing practices. These findings assisted in discovering the
influence of the strength between the difficulties and practices of the information security risk management approach in ICT
outsourcing projects. The findings reveal that risk treatment plan implementation and risk monitoring process difficulties
could not influence the practices of private and government agencies with respect to their ICT outsourcing project implementations. Furthermore, the findings could encourage additional research to improve process adaptability by improving
the usability and flexibility of the processes suitable for the ICT outsourcing environment. As a result, managing information
security risks in ICT outsourcing becomes more effective through dedicated processes designed for information security risk
management in ICT outsourcing.
Zhang, Borisov, and Yurcik [17] analyze the logs used for security analysis with a concern for privacy and propose
constraints on the anonymization of security monitor logs. They believe that if the anonymization solution fulfills the
constraints, managed security services providers (MSSPs) can efficiently detect attacks and simultaneously protect privacy.
They propose a new architecture for outsourced security monitoring, in which anonymized logs are sent to a monitoring
provider to protect the security and privacy of an organization. The new architecture can remove an important barrier to
the use of MSSPs. Their studies show that our proposed architecture represents a promising approach for future security

monitoring. Therefore, they define three areas of future research, explore different types of attacks and analyses different
types of logs, and correlate logs across multiple organizations. They believe that such research will assist in deploying
outsourced MSSPs that become both more widespread and more effective.
Kandias, Mylonas, Theoharidou, and Gritzalis [6] attempt to mitigate the ICT outsourcing problem by applying an auctioning scheme. By adopting the scheme, the involved organization selects one or more potential outsourced service
providers through an auction similar to the FCC spectrum auctions. The ultimate goal is to achieve upgraded security while
keeping costs at a reasonable level and meeting adequate security requirements. The authors present a model for more
security-aware project allocation in outsourcing environments and show its applicability using a case study. The model
decides on the best provider and offers the maximum possible security outcome. In this direction, their model provokes competition and motivates providers to place superior bids, in terms of security, while providing flexibility to the
organization.
Khidzir, Mohamed, and Arshad [11] discuss the determination of information security risk factors consisting of threats
and vulnerabilities, and consider their criticalness in Malaysian ICT outsourcing projects. The findings of the research show
that the most critical threats are system errors and ICT failures, and that the most critical vulnerability is insufficient
attention to the human factors in system design and implementation. Meanwhile, the critical risk factors related to information security vulnerability provide insufficient attention to the human factors in system design and ICT implementation. Furthermore, these findings could assist ICT security professionals in strategically preparing an appropriate mitigation
plan for their ICT outsourcing project and, thus, enable organizations to gain optimal benefit from their ICT outsourcing
activities.
Ying [16] notes that risk matrix methods are used to assess the information security risks of IT services outsourcing. By
constructing an expert two-dimensional matrix and using Borda sequencing and the AHP analytic hierarchy process method,
the qualitative process is quantified and the objectivity of the assessment is further enhanced. The assessment result is in
accordance with the company’s actual IT service outsourcing information security situation. Therefore, the company should
pay attention to the following aspect of work in subsequent work performance to strengthen information safety control
measures, to formulate risk transfer plans, and to improve IT service outsourcing’s information security index. This theory
and case demonstrate that the matrix analysis method, which is based on an asset-threat and vulnerability assessment
index, is a simple and flexible information security risk assessment method. This method is feasible for use in assessing the
information security risk related to IT service outsourcing.
Endorf [2] discusses the need for outsourcing security, determining the risks, choosing a provider, and managing the
process. The premise is that an organization can successfully use outsourcing as a tool to save money by allowing outside
providers to perform non-core competencies. They state that what should be outsourced can be decided through a risk
analysis to identify the threats that one’s organization faces and should mitigate against. Then, using outsourcing analysis,
what is best to outsource to another service provider is determined. Many services can be outsourced and, once determined,
one needs to select the provider that meets the criteria and manage the process using industry best practices: general
explanation of outsourcing security.
Wei, OIConneU, and Loho-Noya [15] aim to discover information security risk factors and provide safeguards for
IT offshore outsourcing. Specifically, first, information security risks and safeguards are identified during IT offshore
outsourcing on the basis of the literature review and interviews with subject matter experts. An IT offshore outsourcing
process (ITOOP) model was developed to logically link these information security risks on the basis of a flow and task analysis
in the client and vendor environments. This paper provides a brief but comprehensive outline of the flows involved in making
offshoring decisions and identifies common risks applicable to the process—and when they occur. Moreover, the paper
attempts to minimize information security issues by developing a table that shows all of the efficient and effective safeguards
to data security threats. Their research describes 18 technical, data, and human safeguards that assist in strengthening
information security in global IT outsourcing. This paper shows that human safeguards are the most appropriate response
to all types of information security threats, identified security risk factors, and developed safeguards for IT offshoring in
general.
Peak, Windsor, and Conover [13] address outsourcing risk issues with a securities market assessment of outsourcing. The
paper examines the effect of outsourcing announcements on firm value and firm risk using empirical data. The findings of
this research are as follows. Large-company IS/IT outsourcing has a value-neutral but risk-changing effect on the firm, as
measured by the initial reactions of company stocks and listed options. Market reactions observed in the stock-return series
indicated few statistically significant abnormal effects on firm value on the day of the outsourcing announcement. This result
is somewhat surprising because previous sale-and-leaseback studies show predominantly positive effects and because IS
research also finds positive effects. In the stock-option risk portion of the event study, this research examines the market
assessment of outsourcing on a principal indicator of firm risk: extracted ISDs from firm stock options. Many subsamples
show significant increases in average ISDs and, more importantly, no samples show significant decreases in average ISDs.
Karyda, Mitrou, and Quirchmayr [8] seek to provide an overview of the major technical, organizational, and legal issues
pertaining to the outsourcing of IS/IT security services. They state that, because of its particular organizational, legal, and
technical aspects, security outsourcing should be treated differently from traditional IS/IT outsourcing. Organizations’ management needs to consider a multitude of factors before engaging in a security outsourcing arrangement. Organizations
need to account for not only technical but also organizational and legal issues when formulating their strategy with regard
to IS/IT security outsourcing.

3. ICT outsourcing security level measurement model design
3.1. ICT outsourcing process design
To measure the security level of ICT outsourcing, a clear distinction of the implementation steps of ICT outsourcing is
needed. Accordingly, previous studies were reviewed as references for reconfiguration on the basis of temporal–spatial
cutoff points. The ICT outsourcing process was divided into four steps: 1. Internal Status Analysis and Bidding & Contract; 2.
Task Preparation; 3. Service Development; and 4. System Operational Management. Fig. 1 illustrates the specific activities
of each process.
Step 1 is for analyzing internal status of organization, and giving public notice of a bid by establishing schedules before &
after implementing ICT outsourcing project, and finalizing contract with final bid winner after evaluating proposals. In specific, ‘1.1 Internal analysis & scheduling’ is for analyzing organization’s status and assets needed to implement outsourcing
project such as organization’s ICT resource status and internal structure, and scheduling specific schedules from outsourcing project contracting period and development start period to completion and system application periods. ‘1.2 Bid notice’
is for preparing request for proposal as an indication of will to publicly notify the content of task, and preparing proposal
guidelines including the proposal standard, table of contents, preparation instruction and evaluation criteria for fairness and
convenience of evaluation to notify bid. ‘1.3 Proposal evaluation’ is for organizing proposal evaluation committee consisting
of inside and outside experts of organization to classify outsourcing company’s proposal into technical, price and security
evaluations to evaluate proposal based on objective criteria. ‘1.4 Contract’ is for preparing task order indicating the requirement of tasks in outsourcing project contract upon selecting priority negotiation partner based on proposal evaluation, and
contracting contents determined during negotiation in documents.
Step 2 is for selecting personnel that will participate in ICT outsourcing project, and configuration work environment by
bringing in equipment needed for project, and establishing management plan needed when implementing ICT outsourcing
task, and sharing specific contents of proposal with personnel participating in the project. In specific, ‘2.1 Confirmation
of work environment’ is for composing internal task implementation team, and configuring suitable work environment
by bringing in equipment (PC, network tools, etc.) that will be used by outsourcing company staff. ‘2.2 Management plan
development and proposed content sharing’ is for establishing management plan (report system, performance index plan,
risk response plan, etc.) needed to implement the project, and sharing the contents of proposal prepared based on the goal
and scope of ICT outsourcing project with personnel participating in the project.
Step 3 is for developing/establishing system, analyzing its performance, coordinating specifics, providing education
for service and measuring performance through trial operation before implementing service. In specific, ‘3.1 System development’, as a step of developing ICT system by personnel participating in outsourcing project, is for periodically and
non-periodically conducting inspection and audit of the implementation progress by outsourcing company during the system development, and preparing completion report after completing the system development. ‘3.2 System performance
analysis & modification’ is for installing system according to the installation plan of developed system, and performing trial
operation, and analyzing the system based on checklist, and deducing modification items to apply the modification and
supplementation items discussed with outsourcing company to the system. ‘3.3 Service development’ is for providing user
education regarding the system according to system education plan, and measuring education outcome through test/survey
research, and implementing service.

system, system failure and leakage of important internal information through ongoing system monitoring, and periodically
updating the system to respond to vulnerabilities such as malware and virus. ‘4.2 System failure response’ is for classifying
system failure that occurred according to prepared manual, and deducing solution to quickly report and handle failure, and
preparing detailed reports of cause and result of system failure occurrence to manage and store them, and reflecting them
to system and manual.
3.2. ICT outsourcing security vulnerability and countermeasure deduction
The security vulnerabilities of ICT outsourcing deduced from previous studies were divided into ICT outsourcing process
and control item units. First, the security vulnerabilities of ICT outsourcing deduced from previous studies were analyzed. In
addition, these deduced security vulnerabilities were divided into managerial, technical, and physical elements on the basis
of expert consultation for deductions, as shown in Table 1.
In addition, 34 countermeasures were deduced to solve ICT outsourcing security vulnerabilities on the basis of the
security control items of ISO 27001 and the information security management system (ISMS) utilized in a form suitable
for inspecting security management status, and they were linked with vulnerabilities (see Fig. 2).
3.3. ICT outsourcing security vulnerability and security countermeasure validity analysis
To analyze ICT outsourcing security vulnerabilities and the validity of security countermeasures (see Table 2),
survey research was conducted with 50 security experts working at public institutions, schools, and private companies.
Conventionally, the probability of a security accident occurring multiplied by seriousness is displayed in numbers to measure
the size of the risk [15,8]. To measure the size of the security vulnerability risk of ICT outsourcing, the probability of a
security accident occurring because of a lack of security countermeasures against the corresponding security vulnerability
and the degree of seriousness of the security accident that occurred were examined by security experts. For the research,
Likert’s five-point scale was used, with 5 being the highest or most desirable and 1 being the lowest or most undesirable.
Respective five-point scale values for each item researched were calculated by converting them as follows: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1 :
1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0]. Table 3 shows the probability and seriousness of security vulnerability occurrences for quantification
purposes. The degree of risk was calculated by multiplying the conventional measurement method occurrence probability
by seriousness.
The validity of the probability of occurrence, the seriousness of the security vulnerability of ICT outsourcing, and the
connection between each security vulnerability and the accorded security countermeasure were examined. This study also
analyzed the reliability of the probability of occurrence and the seriousness of the security vulnerability of ICT outsourcing,
and the corresponding security countermeasures. The result of analyzing the reliability of the survey questions on security
vulnerabilities showed that the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was found to be higher than 0.6 for every item, indicating that
all of the items are reliable. The result of analyzing the validity showed that no item had a response value lower than 3.0

on the validity of security vulnerabilities and security countermeasures. Because the response value of validity is higher
than 3.0, the connection between the corresponding security vulnerabilities and security countermeasures was found to be
valid [15]. Table 4 shows the result of the analysis of the validity of security vulnerabilities and security countermeasures.
3.4. Development of ICT outsourcing security level quantification model
On the basis of the vulnerabilities deduced to measure the security level of ICT outsourcing, a checklist was used to inspect
whether the security countermeasures have been implemented or will be designed.
The central focus of this study is to deduce diagnostic indexes to quantify the security level of ICT outsourcing, followed
by ensuring the reliability of scores (security level) calculated using the deduced diagnostic indexes. Accordingly, weighted
values were used to discriminatively apply the security countermeasure scores depending on the degree of the risk of the
security vulnerabilities in each security area. The current data make it difficult to deduce and reflect on quantitative data,
such as statistical data, to determine the importance of security countermeasures for each security area. Accordingly, a

simple additive weighting method was used in this study on the basis of the degree of risk of security vulnerabilities deduced
through survey research to assign weighted values to security countermeasures according to each security area.

J. Moon et al. / Discrete Applied Mathematics 241 (2018) 67–77

A simple additive weighting method is used to examine the relative weighted values of each rated score by aggregating
the scores of evaluation standards and allowing the sum of the relative weighted values to become 1 for normalization. The

For example, statistical research was used to reveal that a particular database in a computer system of a computer
network in a certain region is attacked by a hacker. The following is an example of an information technology expert’s
evaluation of a particular database from the aspects of availability, integrity, and confidentiality as the information security
requirements in this region. Because the weighted value is larger than 0 and smaller than 1, it can be quantified through the
weighted mean of {M (0.5) + L(1.0) + M (0.5)}/3 = 0.67 [8].
A simple additive weighting method was used in this study that applied a degree of risk measured through a survey to
calculate the weighted values of security countermeasures according to security vulnerabilities. In addition, weighted values
were multiplied by 100 to create a perfect score of 100 for the security level of the ICT outsourcing security level evaluation
model. Weighted scores provided according to the degree of security vulnerability risk were divided by the number of
security countermeasures corresponding to the security vulnerabilities to result in the same value according to the security
countermeasures.
When the set corresponding to the degree of risk of security vulnerabilities is {a, b, c . . . m} and the degree of risk of
security vulnerability UA is a, the weighted score of UA considering the relative weights as follows.
UA =

  
m

a

× 100.

a

Such a weighted score was divided by the number of security countermeasures of security vulnerability UA to allow each
security countermeasure to have the same percentage of the weighted score.
Accordingly, the design allowed users to aggregate the checked item scores from the security countermeasures checklist
to ultimately calculate the ICT outsourcing security score using a perfect score of 100 for quantification purposes. However,
the same security countermeasures for different security vulnerabilities were quantified as the aggregated score of each
weighted score after considering them important security countermeasures to manage various security vulnerabilities.
Accordingly, important security countermeasures were designed to have high weighted scores.
The security level inspection item of ICT outsourcing was primarily linked with a response plan according to the
characteristics of the inspection item to enable division into the ‘‘managerial area’’, the ‘‘technical area’’, and the ‘‘physical
area’’.
The security level evaluation indexes of ICT outsourcing are divided into inspection item, checklist form answer to verify
the implementation status of the corresponding inspection item, and the score of the corresponding inspection item. The
inspection items are composed into the form of a checklist because checklists composed of questions on the implementation
status of security countermeasures can also allow for security countermeasures to be presented [8]. Accordingly, inspection
items allow security personnel to understand the security countermeasures of ICT outsourcing, whereas companies can
understand the currently lacking security countermeasures. Table 5 shows the quantification model of the ICT outsourcing
security level designed in this study by applying the weighted scores of ICT outsourcing security countermeasures.
4. Empirical analysis of ICT outsourcing security level quantification model
For the purpose of examining the accuracy of the quantification model for the security level of ICT outsourcing designed
in this study, it was decided to apply it to actual companies. Comparison target to be compared with corresponding model
is needed to verify the validity of the model but there is currently no study on a model for quantifying the security level of
ICT outsourcing. Accordingly, the model designed in this study was applied to actual companies to deduce results.

The result of applying the security level model showed that Company A with 67.7 points was found to be ‘‘vulnerable’’ in
security. Because Company A is small, no security personnel and organization in charge of security existed. In addition, the
company lacked system/network security and equipment/smart device security. In addition, it lacked security management
of an access/restricted area given the lack of a restricted area inside the company’s facilities. The score section of the security
level evaluation result showed that it was at ‘‘the level of partially responding to security risk but needing an overall
improvement because it is responding randomly without a clear standard’’.
4.2. Measurement of ICT outsourcing security level of Company B in wholesale mart & sales promotion business
Company B is a company involved in the business of dispatching human resources for wholesale market and sales
promotions. In 2013, the company implemented ICT outsourcing for its human resource management and wage payment
program for effective management of human resources. The quantification model for ICT outsourcing security level was
applied to Company B. In the result of model applied, contents on inspection item were excluded. The result of measuring
the security level of Company B using the quantification model of ICT outsourcing security level designed in this study is as
shown in Table 7.
The result of applying the security level model showed that Company B with 90.3 points was found to be ‘satisfactory’ in
security. Although it is a small size company but with more employees compared to Company A, it had security personnel
and a small organization in charge of security. Its security was overall effective but lack security in the area of background
check of personnel participating in ICT outsourcing and equipment being brought in & out. Based on the score section of
security level evaluation result, it was found to be at ‘the level of measuring and managing security risk and being able to
plan and continuously implement security countermeasures but requiring partial improvement’.

5. Conclusion
The ICT outsourcing market is becoming larger every year as a result of the increasing number of companies that utilize
ICT outsourcing as the industry’s scale increases and industrial specialization intensifies. However, the current circumstance
is that security accidents related to ICT outsourcing are continuously occurring at an increasing scale. Studies are lacking on
measuring the level of organizational ICT outsourcing security management, which is the first step in performing security
management of ICT outsourcing. In addition, most studies are on general organizational security management. Accordingly,
this paper designed a model to measure the level of the security management of companies utilizing ICT outsourcing and
verified its applicability through empirical analysis. A summary of the results of this study is as follows.

• The concept and process of ICT outsourcing were summarized. In addition, security vulnerabilities were deduced on the
basis of the ICT outsourcing process for mapping with security countermeasures.

• The validity of security countermeasures and the ICT outsourcing security vulnerabilities mapped were examined, and
the degree of the risk of security vulnerability was measured. Based on the degree of risk of the security vulnerabilities
deduced, a simple additive weighting method was used to calculate the weighted scores of security vulnerabilities.
Therefore, a quantification model was designed to measure the ICT outsourcing security level consisting of 33 inspection
items in six evaluation areas.
• Using the designed model, empirical analysis was conducted through two companies, and the security vulnerabilities of
two companies were deduced on the basis of the areas of improvement that were analyzed.
The implication of this study is that a quantified model was designed to evaluate the security level of ICT outsourcing.
Moreover, a method to evaluate the security level of ICT outsourcing was developed to allow companies to evaluate their
own security levels. Using the model and evaluation method to evaluate the security level of ICT outsourcing, companies
are expected to evaluate the security level of each inspection item and use them as a security countermeasure method.
Therefore, for companies using or planning to use ICT outsourcing to prevent security accidents or that lack industrial
confidentiality and important information to evaluate their security level, this study will assist them in using ICT outsourcing
as a security management countermeasure to improve their security levels.
As for future study, a model considering the business characteristics such as type of business and scale will be developed
since ICT outsourcing is implemented in different ways according to the characteristics of industry. In addition, its
applicability will be verified by applying it to multiple companies instead of a pilot type empirical analysis.
